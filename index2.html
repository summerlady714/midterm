    <p>I'm Crys your driver for the evening.  I have car chargers for both Apple and Android, cough drops, gum, hand sanitizer, tissue, barf bags, and wifi for the kiddo's tablets.</p>
    
    <p>I'm going to answer the typical questions that i get as a driver. This is my secondary income.I only drive at night Thursday thru Saturday and during the day Sunday. No I'm not afraid to drive at night as I am pretty well equipped for self-defense. I don't mind long rides because I love to drive, so of course I'll take you into the city. One of my longest rides was from Lebanon New Jersey to Greenwich CT. I call myself NJ Road Queen because I have seen much of New Jersey from tip to tip. </p>
